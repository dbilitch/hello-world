Learning about github

I've used a few source code control systems over the years.  I'm new to Github, so I'm running through the Hello World tutorial to see what's what.

I've set up a file association for .md files to open in WordPad.  It will likely mean that I have to go through the *save it as a text file* stuff to save the file, but oh well.
