This is a text file called README.txt.  I created it
because I don't have an application associated with 
.md files, which should just open in Notepad or 
Wordpad.  Sigh!

OK, so I created a pull request for the new
README.txt.  You then have to merge the pull
request on the Github site.  I used the squash
and merge option to limit the number of commits
on the main branch.

I came back to the desktop app and did a sync.
This didn't quite work as I expected as it seemed
to only sync the branch I was working on.  I then
synced the main branch and it showed the merge
commit on that branch, but just displayed it as a
commit, not a merge.  Maybe because of the squash
option?
