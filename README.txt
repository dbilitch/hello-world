OK, the desktop version would no longer login to github.
I tried to remove and install the updated version, but
it gets an error trying to install.

The git shell seems to be still working.  This comment is
to test using the git command line to continue working
with the github repositories.

This is a text file called README.txt.  I created it
because I don't have an application associated with 
.md files, which should just open in Notepad or 
Wordpad.  Sigh!

OK, so I created a pull request for the new
README.txt.  You then have to merge the pull
request on the Github site.  I used the squash
and merge option to limit the number of commits
on the main branch.

I came back to the desktop app and did a sync.
This didn't quite work as I expected as it seemed
to only sync the branch I was working on.  I then
synced the main branch and it showed the merge
commit on that branch, but just displayed it as a
commit, not a merge.  Maybe because of the squash
option?
